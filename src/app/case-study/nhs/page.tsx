            The experience for many users was far from what they had hoped for.
            Despite the app&apos;s promise of easier access to healthcare, a lot
            of people found it challenging to use or did not use it at all.
            Because of these difficulties, many people still choose to stick
            with the old, non-technology ways of accessing the NHS. They went
            back to the old-fashioned methods, which kind of defeated the
            purpose of having the app in the first place.

            The goal of this research is to seek insight into the reasons behind
            the app&apos;s low adoption rate, identify areas for improvement,
            create solutions, test them, and make recommendations on how to
            enhance its adoption based on our findings
