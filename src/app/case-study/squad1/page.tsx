            <p className="">
              Due to the pandemic, small businesses in Nigeria had to move
              online to survive, using social media as their new storefront. But
              managing payments was tasking. Existing payment options were slow,
              expensive, and hard to use, making it tough for businesses to keep
              up with orders and grow.
